# React Native + Expo Go Starter Template 🚀

This is a basic template for building React Native applications using [Expo Go](https://expo.dev) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) for styling. It’s a lightweight setup to help you start prototyping or building your next mobile app quickly.

---

## ⚙️ Getting Started

### 1. Clone Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/viraj-perera-dev/expo-tailwind-template.git
```


### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

This will install all required packages defined in `package.json`.

### 2. Run the App

```bash
npm start
```

This will start the Expo development server and display a **QR code** in the terminal.  
Scan it with the **Expo Go mobile app** to view your app live on your device.

> By default, the dev server runs on **port 3002**, but you can change it in the `package.json` file.

## 🧩 Features

- ✅ Built with [Expo](https://expo.dev)
- 🎨 Styled using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) via `nativewind`
- ⚡ Fast refresh for rapid development
- 📁 File-based routing inside the `app` directory (via `expo-router`)

---

## 🧹 Reset the Project (Optional)

If you'd like to start fresh:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This moves the example code to the `app-example` directory and gives you a blank slate inside the `app` folder.
